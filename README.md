This repository is part of the course 'SWENGS' of the Bachelor study 'Information Management' of University of Applied Sciences in Graz.

It contains the frontend using Angular 5 and a RESTful backend written in java.

Our goal was to create a webservice where users can add and remove games to their accounts. 

This project was generated with Angular CLI version 1.5.4.

# prerequisites

node.js from https://node.js
Java 8 JDK (either oracle or openJDK, both were used in developement)

# how to

When using the IntelliJ IDE you have to:

    Create project from existing sources

    npm install
    npm start


Navigate to http://localhost:4200/ with a browser of your choice, although it was tested only on Google Chrome 63 and Firefox 57.  (4200 is the default port and might be different depending on your configuration. the terminal will print the correct port)

Run ng start for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Changes will be reloaded in real time.
